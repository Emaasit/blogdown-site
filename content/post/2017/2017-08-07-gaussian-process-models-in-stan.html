<p>In this post we present RStan, the R interface to Stan. Stan is a C++ library for Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler (a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) or frequentist inference via optimization. We illustrate the features of RStan through an example in <span class="citation">@GelmanCarlinSternRubin:2003</span>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Stan is a C++ library for Bayesian modeling and inference that primarily uses the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) <span class="citation">[@hoffman-gelman:2012]</span> to obtain posterior simulations given a user-specified model and data. Alternatively, Stan can utilize the LBFGS optimization algorithm to maximize an objective function, such as a log-likelihood. The R package <strong>rstan</strong> provides RStan, the R interface to Stan. The <strong>rstan</strong> package allows one to conveniently fit Stan models from R <span class="citation">[@rprj]</span> and access the output, including posterior inferences and intermediate quantities such as evaluations of the log posterior density and its gradients.</p>
