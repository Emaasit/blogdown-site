<p>Incase you missed it, here is a recording of my talk on Introduction to Probabilisitic Machine Learning at the Las Vegas R &amp; Data Science Meetup groups.</p>
<p>I introduced probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic programming with Stan. I discussed the basics of machine learning from a probabilistic/Bayesian perspective and contrasted it with traditional/algorithmic machine learning. I also discussed how to build probabilistic models in computer code using a new exciting programming paradigm called Probabilistic Programming (PP). Particularly I used Stan (within R), a PP language, to build models ranging from simple generalized linear models to complex hierarchical models and nonparametric models for machine learning.</p>
