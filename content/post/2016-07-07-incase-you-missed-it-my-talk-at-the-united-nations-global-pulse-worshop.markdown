In case you missed my talk at the [2016 Data Science Africa Workshop](http://www.datascienceafrica.org/dsa2016/#workshop) organized by the [United Nations Global Pulse Lab](http://unglobalpulse.org/kampala), here is the recording. My talk was titled "_[Sustainable Urban Transport Planning using Big Data from Mobile Phones](https://danielemaasit.com/post/2016/06/28/a-preview-of-my-talk-for-the-data-science-africa-workshop-organized-by-the-united-nations/)_".

There were also talks from my colleagues at [IBM Research - Africa](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/africa/) including Oliver Bent, Simone Fobi and Skyler Speakman who gave a general overview of the work we are doing in our lab in Nairobi, Kenya. Here is their recording:

I would like to thank Dr. John Quinn and the entire team a the [UNGP - Kampala](http://unglobalpulse.org/kampala) for the invitation to speak and for a well organized event.  You can read more about the workshop from this [blog post](http://unglobalpulse.org/news/data-science-in-africa-2016) at the [UNGP blog](http://unglobalpulse.org/blog).

It was great meeting a lot of people from academia, industry, non-profits and government who are using Data Science to solve several challenges on the African continent, ranging from health care to agriculture and to sustainable cities. I look forward to attending more events in the future.
