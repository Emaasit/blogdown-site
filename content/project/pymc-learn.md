It provides a variety of state-of-the art probabilistic models for supervised and unsupervised machine learning. It is inspired by scikit-learn and focuses on bringing probabilistic machine learning to non-specialists. It uses a syntax that mimics scikit-learn. Emphasis is put on ease of use, productivity, flexibility, & performance."

*[pymc-learn](https://www.pymc-learn.org/) is a library for practical probabilistic machine learning in Python*.

It provides a variety of state-of-the art probabilistic models for supervised and unsupervised machine learning. It is inspired by scikit-learn and focuses on bringing probabilistic machine learning to non-specialists. It uses a syntax that mimics scikit-learn. Emphasis is put on ease of use, productivity, flexibility, performance, documentation, and an API consistent with scikit-learn. It depends on scikit-learn and PyMC3 and is distributed under the new BSD-3 license, encouraging its use in both academia and industry.
