# Short Bio

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate of Civil & Transportation Engineering at University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). I am also a graduate research assistant in the Transportation Research Center at UNLV under the supervision of Dr. Alexander Paz. Broadly, my research interests involve the development of flexible probabilistic/Bayesian machine learning methods for high-dimensional data, with applications to Urban Mobility, Transport Planning, Highway Safety, & Traffic Operations.
