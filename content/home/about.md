# Bio

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate of Civil & Transportation Engineering at [University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV)](http://www.unlv.edu/). I am also a graduate research assistant in the [Transportation Research Center](http://web.unlv.edu/centers/trc/index.html) at UNLV under the supervision of [Dr. Alexander Paz](http://web.unlv.edu/centers/trc/paz/). Broadly, my research interests involve the development of [flexible](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) [probabilistic/Bayesian machine learning](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html) methods for high-dimensional data, with applications to Urban Mobility, Smart Cities, Transport Planning, Highway Safety, & Traffic Operations.
