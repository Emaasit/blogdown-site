title = "Introduction to Probabilistic Machine Learning with Stan"
abstract = "Machine Learning has gone mainstream and now powers several real world applications like autonomous vehicles at Uber & Tesla, recommendation engines on Amazon & Netflix, and much more. This meetup will introduce probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic programming with Stan. We will discuss the basics of machine learning from a probabilistic/Bayesian perspective and contrast it with traditional/algorithmic machine learning. We will also discuss how to build probabilistic models in computer code using a new exciting programming paradigm called Probabilistic Programming (PP). Particularly we shall use Stan (within R), a PP language, to build models ranging from simple generalized linear models to complex hierarchical models and nonparametric models for machine learning."
