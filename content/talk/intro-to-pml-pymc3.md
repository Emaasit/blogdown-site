title = "Introduction to Probabilistic Machine Learning with PyMC3"
abstract = "Machine Learning has gone mainstream and now powers several real world applications like autonomous vehicles at Uber & Tesla, recommendation engines on Amazon & Netflix, and much more. In this meetup, I introduced probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic programming with PyMC3. I discussed the basics of machine learning from a probabilistic/Bayesian perspective and contrasted it with traditional/algorithmic machine learning. I also discussed how to build probabilistic models in computer code using a new exciting programming paradigm called Probabilistic Programming (PP). Particularly I used PyMC3, a PP language, to build models ranging from simple generalized linear models to clustering models for machine learning."
