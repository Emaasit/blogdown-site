abstract = "The field of machine learning has seen the development of thousands of learning algorithms. Typically, scientists choose from these algorithms to solve specific problems. Their choices often being limited by their familiarity with these algorithms. In this classical/traditional framework of machine learning, scientists are constrained to making some assumptions so as to use an existing algorithm. This is in contrast to the model-based machine learning approach which seeks to create a bespoke solution tailored to each new problem."
