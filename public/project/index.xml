      <description>Statistical estimation of integrated travel demand models (TDMs) is tedious and involves an iterative process which requires expert knowledge and time to perform several tasks including but not limited to: preprocessing data, selecting appropriate attributes, selecting appropriate models, finding model parameters, and critically analyzing results (Castiglione et al., 2015). Model estimation involves varying some free parameters, hyperparameters, to produce several models which are compared to select the most superior one. Considerable time and expertise are required to tune hyperparameters and consequently select appropriate models; which is prone to subjective error.</description>

      <description>Currently, there is growing research interest in integrated travel demand models that consider simultaneously many influencing factors that affect travel behavior (Pinjari et al., 2011; Pendyala et al., 2012). Integrated models are mathematical representations of real-world decision processes made by travelers. It is typical for travelers to simultaneously make several decisions, such as where to live and work, how many vehicles to own, and decisions regarding their daily activities and travel.</description>

      <title>Latent Travel Patterns from Mobile Phone Data</title>

      <description>Data collected using intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies typically do not include information about the type of associated activity. For instance, cell-phone data typically consist of locations and time stamps of calls made and received. However, the corresponding activity-based travel patterns, such as working or shopping, are not as clear. Similarly, corresponding periodic variations of travel patterns as well as the distinct behavioral clusters of travelers are not explicitly provided in these data sets.</description>
