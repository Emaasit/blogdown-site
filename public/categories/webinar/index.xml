      <description>In case you missed my free webinar on &amp;ldquo;Model-Based Machine Learning&amp;rdquo;, here is the recording.
  Apologies for the poor quality of the video. Domino Data Lab&amp;rsquo;s webinar platform suffered a service degradation while recording the event. The webinar slides may be found below.
 If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Finally, I would like to thank Daniel Enthoven and Daniel Chalef from Domino Data Lab for setting up this webinar.</description>

      <description>I am glad to announce that I shall be presenting a live webinar with Domino Data Labs on July 20, 2016 from 11:00 - 11:30 AM PST on Model-Based Machine Learning and Probabilistic Programming using RStan. If you are interested in adopting machine learning but are overwhelmed by the vast amount of learning algorithms, this webinar will show how to overcome that challenge. This blog post describes most of the material we will cover in the webinar.</description>
