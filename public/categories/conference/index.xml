      <description>I am excited to be invited by the United Nations Global Pulse lab to speak at the 2nd Data Science Africa Workshop scheduled to take place in Kampala, Uganda from 30th June to 1st July. The theme of this workshop is &amp;ldquo;Using data science to monitor and achieve the global goals (UNDP goals) in Africa&amp;rdquo;. I will be speaking particularly on &amp;ldquo;Data Science for Sustainable Cities&amp;rdquo;. My talk is titled: &amp;ldquo;Sustainable Urban Transport Planning using Big Data from Mobile Phones&amp;rdquo;; which is the work I am doing as part of my PhD research.</description>
