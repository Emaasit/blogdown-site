Several scientific fields such as insider-threat detection, highway-safety planning, often lack sufficient amounts of time-series training data for the purpose of scientific discovery. Moreover, the available limited data are quite noisy. For instance Greitzer and Ferryman (2013) state that ”ground truth” data on actual insider behavior is typically either not available or is limited. In some cases, one might acquire real data, but for privacy reasons, there is no attribution of any individuals relating to abuses or offenses i.</description>
