      <description>(Note: Cross-posted with the Haystax Technology Blog.)
At Haystax Technology, we are proponents and early adopters of principled approaches to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) for cybersecurity.
We use the term &amp;lsquo;principled AI&amp;rsquo; to describe what we call our model-based approach, which is built on coherent mathematical principles. These principles help us keep our AI transparent, explainable and interpretable. Most importantly, they enable our systems to quantify uncertainty, unlike the black-box approach of deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>(Note: Cross-posted with the Haystax Technology Blog.)
Several scientific fields such as insider-threat detection, highway-safety planning, often lack sufficient amounts of time-series training data for the purpose of scientific discovery. Moreover, the available limited data are quite noisy. For instance Greitzer and Ferryman (2013) state that ”ground truth” data on actual insider behavior is typically either not available or is limited. In some cases, one might acquire real data, but for privacy reasons, there is no attribution of any individuals relating to abuses or offenses i.</description>

      <description>In case you missed them, here are some articles from November 2017 of particular interest to users of Probabilistic Programming Languages(PPL).
 Uber AI Lab open sourced their deep probabilistic programming language called Pyro. Pyro is a tool for deep probabilistic modeling, unifying the best of modern deeplearning and Bayesian modeling.
 PyMC3 documentation was improved with new styling and builds on travis. You can help at this link.

      <description>Incase you missed it, here is a recording of my talk on Introduction to Probabilisitic Machine Learning at the Las Vegas R &amp;amp; Data Science Meetup groups.
I introduced probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic programming with Stan. I discussed the basics of machine learning from a probabilistic/Bayesian perspective and contrasted it with traditional/algorithmic machine learning. I also discussed how to build probabilistic models in computer code using a new exciting programming paradigm called Probabilistic Programming (PP).</description>

      <description>I am glad to announce that I shall be presenting a live webinar with Domino Data Labs on July 20, 2016 from 11:00 - 11:30 AM PST on Model-Based Machine Learning and Probabilistic Programming using RStan. If you are interested in adopting machine learning but are overwhelmed by the vast amount of learning algorithms, this webinar will show how to overcome that challenge. This blog post describes most of the material we will cover in the webinar.</description>

      <description>In case you missed my talk at the 2016 Data Science Africa Workshop organized by the United Nations Global Pulse Lab, here is the recording. My talk was titled &amp;ldquo;Sustainable Urban Transport Planning using Big Data from Mobile Phones&amp;rdquo;.
 You can download slides for my talk from here.
 There were also talks from my colleagues at IBM Research - Africa including Oliver Bent, Simone Fobi and Skyler Speakman who gave a general overview of the work we are doing in our lab in Nairobi, Kenya.</description>

      <description>I am excited to be invited by the United Nations Global Pulse lab to speak at the 2nd Data Science Africa Workshop scheduled to take place in Kampala, Uganda from 30th June to 1st July. The theme of this workshop is &amp;ldquo;Using data science to monitor and achieve the global goals (UNDP goals) in Africa&amp;rdquo;. I will be speaking particularly on &amp;ldquo;Data Science for Sustainable Cities&amp;rdquo;. My talk is titled: &amp;ldquo;Sustainable Urban Transport Planning using Big Data from Mobile Phones&amp;rdquo;; which is the work I am doing as part of my PhD research.</description>

      <description>Introduction The objective of this blog post is demonstrate how to use Apache SparkR to power Shiny applications. I have been curious about what the use cases for a &amp;ldquo;Shiny-SparkR&amp;rdquo; application would be and how to develop and deploy such an app.
SparkR is an R package that provides a light-weight frontend to use Apache Spark from R. SparkR provides a distributed data frame implementation that supports operations like selection, filtering, aggregation etc.</description>
