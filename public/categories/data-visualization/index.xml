      <description>A couple of months ago, I announced the ggplot2-extensions website which tracks and lists extensions built on top of the popular R visualization package ggplot2.
Now, I wanted to make it even easier for R users to filter and search for these extensions and so I have added a Gallery page. You can now search packages based on a filter like: if it&amp;rsquo;s on CRAN; or if it&amp;rsquo;s for a particular task e.</description>

      <title>Tracking ggplot2 Extensions</title>

      <description>Introduction The purpose of this blog post is to inform R users of a website that I created to track and list ggplot2 extensions. The site is available at: http://ggplot2-exts.github.io. The purpose of this site is to help other R users easily find ggplot2 extensions that are coming in &amp;ldquo;fast and furious&amp;rdquo; from the R community.
If you have developed or intend on developing ggplot2 extensions, submit them so that other R users can easily find them.</description>
