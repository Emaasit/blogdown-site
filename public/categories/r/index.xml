      <description>Incase you missed it, here is a recording of my talk on Introduction to Probabilisitic Machine Learning at the Las Vegas R &amp;amp; Data Science Meetup groups.
I introduced probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic programming with Stan. I discussed the basics of machine learning from a probabilistic/Bayesian perspective and contrasted it with traditional/algorithmic machine learning. I also discussed how to build probabilistic models in computer code using a new exciting programming paradigm called Probabilistic Programming (PP).</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago, I announced the ggplot2-extensions website which tracks and lists extensions built on top of the popular R visualization package ggplot2.
Now, I wanted to make it even easier for R users to filter and search for these extensions and so I have added a Gallery page. You can now search packages based on a filter like: if it&amp;rsquo;s on CRAN; or if it&amp;rsquo;s for a particular task e.</description>

      <guid>/post/2016/02/01/tracking-ggplot2-extensions/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The purpose of this blog post is to inform R users of a website that I created to track and list ggplot2 extensions. The site is available at: http://ggplot2-exts.github.io. The purpose of this site is to help other R users easily find ggplot2 extensions that are coming in &amp;ldquo;fast and furious&amp;rdquo; from the R community.
If you have developed or intend on developing ggplot2 extensions, submit them so that other R users can easily find them.</description>

      <description>Introduction The objective of this blog post is demonstrate how to use Apache SparkR to power Shiny applications. I have been curious about what the use cases for a &amp;ldquo;Shiny-SparkR&amp;rdquo; application would be and how to develop and deploy such an app.
SparkR is an R package that provides a light-weight frontend to use Apache Spark from R. SparkR provides a distributed data frame implementation that supports operations like selection, filtering, aggregation etc.</description>

      <description>Introduction
In this blog post, we shall learn how to launch a Spark stand alone cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for analysis of Big Data. This is a continuation from our previous blog, which showed us how to download Apache Spark and start SparkR locally on windows OS and RStudio.
We shall use Spark 1.5.1 (released on October 02, 2015) which has a spark-ec2 script that is used to install stand alone Spark on AWS EC2.</description>

      <description>Introduction
With the recent release of Apache Spark 1.4.1 on July 15th, 2015, I wanted to write a step-by-step guide to help new users get up and running with SparkR locally on a Windows machine using command shell and RStudio. SparkR provides an R frontend to Apache Spark and using Spark’s distributed computation engine allows R-Users to run large scale data analysis from the R shell. The steps listed here WILL also be documented in my upcoming online book titled &amp;ldquo;Getting Started with SparkR for Big Data Analysis&amp;rdquo; which can be accessed at: http://www.</description>
