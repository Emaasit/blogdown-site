      <description>Currently, there is growing research interest in integrated travel demand models that consider simultaneously many influencing factors that affect travel behavior (Pinjari et al., 2011; Pendyala et al., 2012). Integrated models are mathematical representations of real-world decision processes made by travelers. It is typical for travelers to simultaneously make several decisions, such as where to live and work, how many vehicles to own, and decisions regarding their daily activities and travel.</description>
