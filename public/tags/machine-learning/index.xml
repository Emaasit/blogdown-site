At Haystax Technology, we are proponents and early adopters of principled approaches to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) for cybersecurity.
We use the term &amp;lsquo;principled AI&amp;rsquo; to describe what we call our model-based approach, which is built on coherent mathematical principles. These principles help us keep our AI transparent, explainable and interpretable. Most importantly, they enable our systems to quantify uncertainty, unlike the black-box approach of deep neural networks.</description>

Several scientific fields such as insider-threat detection, highway-safety planning, often lack sufficient amounts of time-series training data for the purpose of scientific discovery. Moreover, the available limited data are quite noisy. For instance Greitzer and Ferryman (2013) state that ”ground truth” data on actual insider behavior is typically either not available or is limited. In some cases, one might acquire real data, but for privacy reasons, there is no attribution of any individuals relating to abuses or offenses i.</description>

      <title>ICYMI: My talk on Introduction to Probabilistic Machine Learning</title>

      <description>Incase you missed it, here is a recording of my talk on Introduction to Probabilisitic Machine Learning at the Las Vegas R &amp;amp; Data Science Meetup groups.
I introduced probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic programming with Stan. I discussed the basics of machine learning from a probabilistic/Bayesian perspective and contrasted it with traditional/algorithmic machine learning. I also discussed how to build probabilistic models in computer code using a new exciting programming paradigm called Probabilistic Programming (PP).</description>

      <title>Automating Hyperparameter tuning</title>

      <description>Statistical estimation of integrated travel demand models (TDMs) is tedious and involves an iterative process which requires expert knowledge and time to perform several tasks including but not limited to: preprocessing data, selecting appropriate attributes, selecting appropriate models, finding model parameters, and critically analyzing results (Castiglione et al., 2015). Model estimation involves varying some free parameters, hyperparameters, to produce several models which are compared to select the most superior one. Considerable time and expertise are required to tune hyperparameters and consequently select appropriate models; which is prone to subjective error.</description>
